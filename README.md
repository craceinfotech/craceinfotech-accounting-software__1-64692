I have developed Accounting Software in Visual Basic 6 and Foxpro Database while I started my career in Software development ( Around 1997).

At that time , I have published this code in public forum.

As this is my intial coding, I can say it is a working code, but not efficient code following all best practices.

It served the purpose at that time.

Actually , I have developed another software based on this code base for Milk Societies near Thirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India ( 4 societies) , And I am very proud to say that the application developed by me is working for more than 15 years without any issues ( They have changed their Computer hardware multiple times with different Windows OS versions, but still they are running it for their day to day use , without any issues.)
